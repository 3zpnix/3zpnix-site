            <h2>Read Eromanga Sensei</h2>
            <p>(Short Brief Review Summary)

The manga did well as I had hoped, just like the anime, and it was quite enjoyable reading through every chapter in mind.

(My Rating Criteria)

✨ Plot: 9.3/10 – Revolving the main character and his (non blood-related) sister finally being able to meet face to face with each other once again was quite amusing and a nice touch to begin with. As for them finally taking it slowly but surely with their current relationship, and how they both want to do their best and develop just based on the turn of events and all these unusual occurrences happening to them. Showing them having the will to resolve their current and future issues by facing certain difficulties both on their own and with friends by their side which I found it quite cute. Sometimes, the plot just hits you in certain aspects with a bit of the reality side of things and how you cannot just force something or someone out of their will and expect them to just change for the better immediately. And this in mind, is where you will understand, that people need time, no matter the duration and how they do it, at least they’re trying y’know. If not, then show them that you truly care, and that you yourself. Mind, body, and soul. Want to understand, and try to understand, alright? Alright. Sorry for blabbering lol.

✨ Characters: 9.8/10 – All the characters were quite likeable in their own way. They did not disappoint me whatsoever with how they are being represented and shown. As they were all worthy to be remembered and what I mean is their names since I don’t usually memorize someone’s name even when I’m already half into to their story.

✨ Art: 10/10 – Now, I’m not going to lie to you, but the art style here in this manga is very endearing and kawaii. It really captures every scene imaginable. It made me think that I was watching the anime but with more of the uncut scenes from the manga. So props to the ones who drew this.

✨ Story: 8.5/10 – Was not boring, I did not feel any sort of drowsiness while reading through every chapter, goes to show you how well-made it was. As it made me feel like another sense of temporary happiness is filling up inside of me, pushing away my aching depression and the vast empty void I am partaking, lol.

✨ Would you recommend this manga to someone you know: Yes, absolutely. But not quite, for some people, since it has a bit of incest which they might not like or not be in par with that sort of genre. But y’know I would still probably recommend this manga to them anyway, lol.

✨ Overall Rating: 9.5/10</p>
